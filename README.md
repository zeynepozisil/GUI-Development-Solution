First of all, "AppServ : Apache + PHP + MYSQL" package must be installed on the computer in order to run PH codes over "localhost".
I used the "Sublime Text" editor as the editor.
When I want to run my PHP codes, I google "localhost".
I see my PHP files in the "Appserv/www/..." path.
When I click on my "CODES" folder that I wrote in this assignment, my GUI design works.

The "css" and "js" folders contain the libraries and structures needed for my GUI design.

The "connection" code is for communicating between our MySQL and PHP code.
The 'root' and '1*******' data I entered are my mysql user and password.

My SQL file named "datatable_example.sql" contains the database I wrote.

My remaining php files (delete_user, fetch_data, get_single_data, update_user, add_user) are the codes of the operations I made in my GUI design.
Required for my "index" file (main script file).
